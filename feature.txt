Adding text to make this file different to test git diff.

Adding a second line for change - I want to figure out how to 'diff' or compare two same files - one 
from origin (local) against one from master on git-hub.

Edited from github - so as to compare using diff. And added a comment - doh!

added ssh key to github acct.

Adding a line from Zorin OS
