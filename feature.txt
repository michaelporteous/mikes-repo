Adding text to make this file different to test git diff.

<<<<<<< HEAD

Adding a second line for change - I want to figure out how to 'diff' or compare two same files - one 
from origin (local) against one from master on git-hub.

=======
Edited from github - so as to compare using diff. And added a comment - doh!
